  Here you can select the ART tests of interest by package, branch, and time window.
  Packages and branches are listed only if at least one test has run in the past 30 days.
  You can change this period by adding <code>&days=X</code> to the URL.
</p>

<p>
  If you do not select any packages or branches, all available ones will be included by default.
</p>

<p>
  The time window is based on nightly tags, i.e., the time the build was created.
  If a test ran a day later, it will still be shown under the nightly tag used for that run.
  If you do not select any nightly tags, results for the last 7 days will be shown.
  Selected nightly tags (via checkboxes) take precedence over the "last N nightlies" or a custom time window.
</p>

<p>
  There are two types of view grouping: by package (default) and by branch.
</p>

<p>
  Three levels of views are available: overview, task, and jobs.
  In the overview, you’ll see global test result statistics for the selected branches and packages, presented as traffic lights.
  In the task view, statistics are broken down by package or branch, depending on your grouping selection.
  In the job view, you’ll see a detailed list of test results. You can also enable the <code>Show subresults</code> option to view exit codes of individual test sub-steps.
