<b>Sites, queues, GOC names</b><br>
PanDA submits jobs to 'PanDA sites'.
  It submits jobs via pilots running on queues defined in a PanDA site database;
  there is typically but not necessarily a 1:1 correspondence between site and associated queue. These are the queues shown above.
  PanDA sites are hosted at facilities that (generally) are part of the WLCG computing infrastructure, and have a name (GOC name) within that infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tier levels</b><br>
Sites are categorized by the familiar Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 levels. A further subcategorization is T2D;
  these are Tier 2s where "D" stays for â€œDirectly connected" and are validated for heavy duty workloads.
</p>

<p>
<b>Online, offline, brokeroff, test</b><br>
Online sites are up and running, able to accept jobs via automatic brokerage or direct assignment.
  Brokeroff sites accept jobs only by direct assignment.
  Test sites accept only test jobs. Offline sites accept no jobs at all.
  The comment field often gives an indication of how the site wound up with the status it presently has.
  Very often this comment indicates that the Hammercloud (HC) automated testing and blacklisting system has taken action.
</p>

<p>
Where sites are served by queues that have maximum allowed memory allocations and/or job execution times, they are so indicated.
